# Social Media Platform Project - 

## General Description - 

In this project, I've successfully crafted a vibrant social platform, drawing on a fusion of advanced technologies to deliver an engaging user experience akin to platforms like Facebook. 
The backbone of this endeavor lies in the strategic use of REST API, enabling seamless communication among diverse components. 
Our choice of PostgreSQL as the relational database, combined with SQLAlchemy's powerful ORM capabilities, ensures efficient data storage and management. 
The development and testing process is made agile with the incorporation of Postman, facilitating effortless API interaction. Security is a top priority, with the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for robust user authentication. 
For deployment, Docker plays a pivotal role in ensuring consistency across various environments, and Nginx acts as the reliable web server, adept at handling HTTP requests.
This comprehensive documentation unveils essential aspects, including API endpoints, intricate data models, the underlying database schema, the intricacies of the authentication flow, 
and a step-by-step guide to deploying the platform seamlessly using Docker and Nginx. Empowering users to navigate, utilize, 
and extend the capabilities of this social platform is at the core of this documentation, reflecting the culmination of innovation and technical prowess in this project.
